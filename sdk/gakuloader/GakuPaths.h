/* Optional service; all existing GakuPlugin.h v1 layouts remain unchanged.
   The host binds context to the querying owner. No caller-supplied plugin id.
   Roots are absolute UTF-16 Windows paths, fixed for this process, under
   localRoot/<category>/<canonical plugin id>. Querying never creates directories.
   Accepted namespaces are ASCII lowercase, <=64 characters, with nonempty dot
   segments containing a-z, 0-9, _ and -; first character must be a-z or 0-9.
   Windows reserved device stems and trailing dots are rejected. Invalid legacy
   ids may still load/use other services; only this service is unavailable to them.
   Paths organise cooperative plugins; they are not an I/O security sandbox. */

       also sets only required: no partial path is ever written.
       NULL output with nonzero capacity, NULL required or an invalid kind returns
       E_INVALID_ARGUMENT. Invalid namespace and all other failures leave both
